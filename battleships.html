                                                Battleships: All Hands On Deck was developed in the context of IST's Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering class Game Design.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The game has the players embody the CEO of competing soda companies in their struggle for soda supremacy against each other.
												Battleships: All Hands On Deck was developed using VASSAL for the duration of 2 weeks.

												<h3>Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												After my game pitch was voted to be made into a real game by the end of the remaining 2 weeks of class, the brainstorming process allowed the team to expand my original idea.
											</p>
											<p>
												The entire shift from a tabletop game to a digital rendition of it was programmed by me through the VASSAL engine.
                                                Originally, we wanted the game to be more story-driven and focused on storytelling, but with the limited timeframe we ended up moving this to a secondary objective, with the tactical aspect being put first.
                                                Because of this, I am sad to report a much smaller game than what had been envisioned. Still, we all gave it our best and the final version of All Hands On Deck was still very fun to play.
											</p>
											<p>
												The original Battleships has an uncontrollable luck factor when it comes to calling shots. In this version I suggested that we take away some of that factor by rewarding players that miss and punishing those who hit.
                                                It worked well, with players reporting that they never really felt like they didn't stood a chance at winning even when the other player was hitting most (if not all) the shots.
											</p>
											<p>
												As head of the development team, I made most of the creative and gameplay decisions. 
                                                However, the input and ideas of my colleagues were very important for the project and I have to credit Rúben for the tactical mechanics and Gonçalo for the brilliant job at conducting the playtesting sessions.

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Leading a team is challenging but teamwork and communication are what makes game development progress. 
                                                I am happy that I was able to direct and guide my team in the creation of this fun expansion of one of my favourite tabletop games.
