                                                <h3>What is it about?</h3>
                                            </header>
                                            <p>
                                                Cow Stealer was developed in the context of IST's Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering class Game Development Methodology.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The premise of the game is that, in order to stop global warming, the government employs the help of aliens to remove the last remaining obstacle to a completely green Earth: the cows. 
												The aliens themselves are going through an ice age and agree to steal the cows in hopes that bringing them to their planet will revert the cold temperatures.
                                            </p>
											<p>
												Cow Stealer is a casual 2D Side-Scroller game built with Unity over the course of 6 weeks.
                                            </p>

												<h3>Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This is my, and the rest of the team, first major group game development assignment. 
												As none of my colleagues had any experience in game-making, I was the one they turned to when in need for advice or bug-solving. All three of them were fast learners and incredible teammates and programmers.
											</p>
											<p>
												Most of my contributions to this game were tied with the integration of the different elements of the game and level design, as well as the side-scrolling mechanics and different level events.
												I was also responsible for all the animation of the different objects and menus, as well as most of the UI.
												The navigation between menus was made in collaboration with my colleague Inês.
											</p>
											<p>
												On a different note, I let my creativity (and GIMP skills) run free on the design of the different game posters and logos.
												I used a pixel art editor to draw the UFO's light beam and my colleagues decided we should use it for the game, as we were using a basic trapezoid shape instead.
												I ended up designing three more beams in order to create a sprite animation for the game.
											</p>
											<p>
												The game was showcased at MoJo, at our university, where we conducted user tests.
												As the most experienced programmer, I was tasked with resolving bugs in real time so that we could give our playtesters the best possible experience.
												I also designed and printed some cards that awarded bragging rights to anyone that completed the playtest, something that our players found very fun.
											</p>
											<p>
												For a more in-depth dive into the development of this game, you can find the development logs on the left as well as other useful links.

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												It was very fun and fullfilling experience, both for us developers and our players. 
												Speaking for myself, I am proud of how the finished product turned out. 
												It was amazing to see so many people try our game and give us feedback, something that hadn't been possible for me in the past.
