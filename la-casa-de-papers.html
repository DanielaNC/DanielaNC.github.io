                                            <p>
                                                La Casa de Papers was developed in the context of IST's Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering class Virtual Reality.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                We were given research papers to choose from and base our application around it.
												My group decided on a virtual reality workspace where you could read, highlight and organize papers.
												The default paper loaded into the scene is the same one we took inspiration from.
                                            </p>
											<p>
												The application was built with Unity for Oculus Quest 2.
                                            </p>
                                        </section>

												<h3>Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												My first contact with Virtual Reality, this project proved challenging from the start.
												For starters, none of our laptops was compatible with the Oculus technology. 
												This proved especially annoying when we could not test the code we had written for the immersive space.
											</p>
											<p>
												Fortunately, my desktop was good enough to support the VR goggles and I was able to fully test the application in development.
												Because of this, I was responsible for testing and fixing bugs, as well as the majority of coding, leaving the aesthetic and non code heavy tasks for the rest of my team.
												This was not a bad thing, as it allowed everyone to focus on what they were better at.
											</p>
											<p>
												My colleagues were both specializing in Interaction and Visualization and their feedback was what allowed the space to have the best possible user interface we could create.
											</p>
											<p>
												It was challenging to implement all the objectives we had set, like the carroussel, the corkboard, the highlighters and erasers.
												We had to scrap some ideas (like the text-to-speech note taker) that proved difficult to work with in VR.
											</p>

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project was a fantastic team effort that provided us with the basis for VR and XR related future works.
