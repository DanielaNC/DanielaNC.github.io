                                            <p>
                                                Auto da Barca do Inferno was developed in the context of IST's Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering class Artificial Intelligence for Games.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This game is based on Gil Vicente's play with the same name. In it, the player answers a set of questions so that the Devil and the Angel can decide where to place their soul.
                                                The AI for the NPCs (Angel and Devil) was made with FAtiMA-Toolkit.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>FAtiMA-Toolkit is an emotion engine for AI characters.</p>

												<h3>Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Deciding what story to convey with intelligent NPCs is always a challenge. Fortunately, Tiago and I were in synch.
                                                We wanted to make something funny. We ended up deciding on a parody of Auto da Barca do Inferno, with a modern Angel and Devil.
											</p>
											<p>
												We started by writing the dialogue script. As you can see in the cover image, we made some references to modern concepts.
                                                Other references include diferential equations (we are college students, after all) and TikTok dances.
											</p>
											<p>
												The final report contains a more detailed description of the AI behaviour, but putting it in simple terms, both the Angel and the Devil 
                                                evaluate the Player's answer and it's that score that decides which ending the Player receives.
                                                There are 4 different endings, two of which depend of that evaluation while the other two can only be reached by choosing specific dialogues.
											</p>
                                            <p>
												Once we had the characters figured out, we looped the dialogue to allow for replays and added text-to-speech so that the Angel and Devil speak at the same time that the dialogue appears.
                                                We also changed the environment and character models to better fit the mood of the story, although I'll admit we could not find decent models for the two NPCs.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                My contributions to this project revolved mainly around creating the emotional models in FAtiMA and replay-ability related scripts.
                                                The story and dialogue was written by both of us.
                                            </p>

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This was one of my favourite projects during college. 
                                                It provided me with insight on storytelling with emotionally intelligent agents in the context of games.
