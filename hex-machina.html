                                            <p>
                                                Hex Machina was developed in the context of IST's Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering class Game Design.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This expansion gives powerup cards to the players that have front and backside abilities.
												Hex Machina was developed using VASSAL for the duration of 2 weeks, as well as a physical copy that can be seen in the cover image.
                                            </p>

												<h3>Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project started with the professors giving us the challenge of building our own narrative and gameplay on top of the original Hex game.
											</p>
											<p>
												The Hex game consists of two players trying to connect their sides of the board.
                                                I suggested we use a mine tunnel metaphor for the connected line but, because it didn't explain why we could build a tunnel anywhere on the map it was then added that it was being constructed by an AI able to dig anywhere in order to achieve the best possible result.
                                                That was when the name Hex Machina was born.
											</p>
											<p>
												The card mechanic works by giving each player 3 cards. These cards are placed face up (the face being the color of the player, blue or red) and only after the front side has been played can the players flip it and use the backside ability.
                                                Although I was not responsible for coming up with this idea, I designed and programmed the mechanic into the digital prototype. I also designed the main board.
											</p>
                                            <p>
												To counter the first player advantage that Hex offers, I added the Breach of Contract card, a single exclusive to the second player card that can only be played on the first turn. 
                                                It allows the second player to steal the first player's tunnel piece. This keeps the first player from choosing an optimal spot on the first turn by fear of having the second player steal it.
                                            </p>

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I had never worked on a digital tabletop game before. Most of my experience prior to this revolved around the Unity engine. It was refreshing and taught me the basics of game design without having to participate in a full-scale million dollar project.
